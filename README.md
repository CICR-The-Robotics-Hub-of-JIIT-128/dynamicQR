# Dynamic QR Code Redirector

A web application built with Node.js and Express that provides a dashboard to manage a dynamic redirect link. This allows a single, permanent QR code to point to different destination URLs, which can be updated in real-time by an administrator.

This project is maintained by the **CICR Robotics Hub of JIIT-128**.


## ‚ú® Features

-   **Admin Authentication**: Secure login for the management dashboard.
-   **Dynamic Link Management**: Create new redirect links, set one as "active," and delete old ones directly from the UI.
-   **Visit Tracking**: Automatically counts how many times the public redirect link is visited.
-   **Dashboard Analytics**: At-a-glance statistics for Total Links, Total Submissions (visits), Active Submissions, and New Links Created This Week.
-   **Single Redirect Route**: A single, fixed URL (`/go`) that always redirects to the currently active link, perfect for use with a static QR code.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and functional dashboard for managing links and viewing stats.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
-   **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
-   **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating)
-   **Authentication**: Express Session, Bcrypt.js
-   **Middleware & Libraries**: `method-override`, `dotenv`, `morgan`
